LeetCode Problem 1679: Max Number of K-Sum Pairs

Problem Description:
You are given an integer array nums and an integer k.
In one operation, you can pick two numbers from the array whose sum equals k and remove them from the array.
Return the maximum number of operations you can perform on the array.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], k = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: Starting with nums = [1,2,3,4]:
- Remove numbers 1 and 4, then nums = [2,3]
- Remove numbers 2 and 3, then nums = []
There are no more pairs that sum up to 5, hence a total of 2 operations.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,1,3,4,3], k = 6
Output: 1
Explanation: Starting with nums = [3,1,3,4,3]:
- Remove the first two 3's, then nums = [1,4,3]
There are no more pairs that sum up to 6, hence a total of 1 operation.

Constraints:
- 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
- 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
- 1 <= k <= 10^9

Time Complexity: O(n log n) - due to sorting
Space Complexity: O(1) - only using two pointers

Approach: Two Pointers (After Sorting)
1. Sort the array
2. Use two pointers: one at start (i) and one at end (j)
3. If sum equals k: increment count and move both pointers
4. If sum < k: move left pointer right (to increase sum)
5. If sum > k: move right pointer left (to decrease sum)
